                    <h3>Chapter 1 - A Social Gathering </h3>
                        <p>Capitan Santiago de los Santos, or Capitan Tiago,
                            hosts a dinner in his house at Calle Anloague.
                            While waiting for the meals to be served, the guests converse with one another.  
                            In these conversations, the readers are introduced to some of the novels characters,
                            such as Padre Damaso, Padre Sibyla, Lieutenant Guevara, Laruja, Doña Victorina de Espadaña,
                            and Don Tiburcio de Espadaña.</p>

                        <p>Capitan Tiago enters the sala and introduces Juan Crisostomo Ibarra y Magsalin to the guests.
                            Crisostomo, he informs them, is the only son of the late Don Rafael Ibarra, and he has recently
                             arrived from his studies in Europe.  Crisostomo is puzzled when Padre Damaso, whom he thought
                            was a friend of his father, arrogantly denies that he was ever a friend of Don Rafael Ibarra.</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 3 - The Dinner</h3>
                        <p>At dinner over Tinola , the conversation of the guests centers on Crisostomos travels to several countries.
                        Padre Damaso belittles Ibarras trips, saying that what he has learned from them can be learned even without
                        leaving the country.  Embarrassed, Ibarra excuses himself from the guests and leaves, even after Capitan Tiago 
                        informs him that Maria Clara is coming to dinner.
