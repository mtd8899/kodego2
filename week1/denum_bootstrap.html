            The best mid-range TV we've tested is the LG C2 OLED. It's a premium TV that delivers stunning picture quality, especially in dark rooms, and it's a well-rounded display that's excellent for a variety of uses. OLEDs like this one are unique because they don't have a backlight and instead can individually turn off pixels, resulting in a near-infinite contrast ratio and no blooming around bright objects. It means it looks fantastic in dark rooms, whether you're watching movies or gaming. Even in well-lit rooms, it gets bright enough to fight glare in most environments, and the reflection handling is incredible, but because it uses an older type of OLED panel, colors aren't as bright as the Samsung S95B OLED or the Samsung QN90B QLED.
